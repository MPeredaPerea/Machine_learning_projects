## **Project Overview**

The project follows a two-step approach:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - The first step involves performing a detailed **descriptive analysis** on the dataset to explore the data's distribution, key features, and relationships. This analysis helps identify useful features and patterns to better understand customer behavior.

2. **Machine Learning Model Evaluation:**
   - Several **machine learning algorithms** are applied to predict churn. Models such as **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests**, and **Gradient Boosting Machines** were tested.
   - The performance of each model was evaluated based on metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score**, and **ROC-AUC** to determine the best-performing model for churn prediction.


## **Steps in the Project**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**:
   - Implementing various classification models and tuning their hyperparameters.
   - Evaluating models using cross-validation and key metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **ROC-AUC**.

4. **Model Comparison**:
   - Comparing the results to identify the best model for predicting churn.

## **Key Metrics**

- **Accuracy**: Overall performance of the model.
- **Precision**: Proportion of true positives in predicted positives.
- **Recall**: Proportion of true positives in actual positives.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful for imbalanced datasets.
- **ROC-AUC**: Measures the model’s ability to distinguish between classes.

## **Results**

- The model performance was compared based on the mentioned metrics, with a focus on finding the most reliable model for predicting churn.
- As the results haven´t been as good as expected on predicting the **class 1 (exited)**, next steps consist on finding new methods to try to improve the results
