# Daily SPOT Price Prediction for Spain

This project focuses on building an ML model to predict the **Daily SPOT Price for Spain**.

This work takes inspiration from the work of **Shivagaje Pranav Ashok**, who used a similar approach to predict electricity demand using the same dataset. You can find the reference notebook here: [Electricity Demand Forecast](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shivagajepranav111a/daily-electricity-demand-forecast-machine-learning/notebook#Model-Building).

This project has an initial notebook containing a [Descriptive Analysis]([https://github.com/MPeredaPerea/Machine_learning_projects/blob/main/Energy_sector/Spain_SPOT_price_ML/Analisis%20descriptivo.ipynb](https://github.com/MPeredaPerea/Machine_learning_projects/blob/main/Energy_sector/Spain_SPOT_price_ML/Descriptive_Analysis.ipynb)) of the available data.

### Project Structure
This project will explore different versions and methods to predict the **Daily SPOT Market Price in Spain**:

- 1.[Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/MPeredaPerea/Machine_learning_projects/blob/main/Energy_sector/Spain_SPOT_price_ML/ML_serie_temporal/ML_serie_temporal.ipynb): A notebook dedicated to predicting the **Daily SPOT Market Price in Spain**, treating the variable as a time series.
