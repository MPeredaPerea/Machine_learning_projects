# Daily SPOT Price Prediction for Spain

This project focuses on building an ML model to predict the **Daily SPOT Price for Spain**. It will be treated as a time series model, using only the variables `datetime` and the **Daily SPOT Price for Spain**. The model takes inspiration from the work of **Shivagaje Pranav Ashok**, who used a similar approach to predict electricity demand using the same dataset in the following notebook: [Electricity Demand Forecast](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shivagajepranav111a/daily-electricity-demand-forecast-machine-learning/notebook#Model-Building).

An initial notebook containing a descriptive analysis of the available data has already been prepared.

This project will explore different versions and methods to predict the **Daily SPOT Market Price in Spain**:

- [Descriptive Analysis](https://github.com/MPeredaPerea/Machine_learning_projects/blob/main/Energy_sector/Spain_SPOT_price_ML/Analisis%20descriptivo.ipynb): A detailed overview of the dataset variables.
- [ML Time Series](https://github.com/MPeredaPerea/Machine_learning_projects/blob/main/Energy_sector/Spain_SPOT_price_ML/ML_serie_temporal/ML_serie_temporal.ipynb): A notebook dedicated to predicting the **Daily SPOT Market Price in Spain**, treating the variable as a time series.
