# Daily SPOT Price Prediction for Spain

This project focuses on building an ML model to predict the **Daily SPOT Price for Spain**.

This work takes inspiration from the work of **Shivagaje Pranav Ashok**, who used a similar approach to predict electricity demand using the same dataset. You can find the reference notebook here: [Electricity Demand Forecast](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shivagajepranav111a/daily-electricity-demand-forecast-machine-learning/notebook#Model-Building).

This project has an initial notebook containing a descriptive analysis of the available data has already been prepared.
